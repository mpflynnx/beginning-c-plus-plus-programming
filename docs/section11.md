### Standard Library functions
C++ has many built in functions contained in the [Standard Library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header). No include statement needed, as these functions are global.

Many popular maths functions are contained in the [`<cmath>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath) header.

```c
#include <cmath>
```
Some functions from the C programming language are contained in [`<cstdlib>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cstdlib) header.
```c
#include <cstdlib>
```

Date and time functions exist in the [`<ctime>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/ctime) header.

```c
#include <ctime>
```

Random number functions exist in the [`<random>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/random) header.

```c
#include <random>
```
