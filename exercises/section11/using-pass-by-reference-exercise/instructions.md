## Using Pass by Reference - Print a Guest List

[udemy.com | Using Pass by Reference - Print a Guest List](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/learn/quiz/4473508#questions)

In this exercise you will rewrite the previous Guest List exercise only this time with the use of reference variables.

In this exercise you will create a program that will be used to print the guest list to an event and then clear the guest list when the event is over.

Begin by completing the function prototypes print_guest_list and clear_guest_list which are both passed three string reference variables. Ensure that the variables cannot be modified within the print_guest_list function by using the keyword const in the parameter list.

Now that the function prototypes have been declared, at the bottom of the file define both functions.

Both the print_guest_list and clear_guest_list functions will be passed the string arguments guest_1, guest_2, and guest_3 which have all been provided to you.

The print_guest_list function should print the guest list in the order of guest_1, guest_2 , guest_3, with each entry being printed on a new line. For testing purposes, please ensure that a newline is printed after guest_3 either through the use of endl; or the newline character "\n". 

The clear_guest_list function should replace the string values contained within guest_1, guest_2, and guest_3 with the string value " ", a single space.

Now, from the function body of event_guest_list, make the following function calls in this order:

print_guest_list

clear_guest_list

print_guest_list

passing guest_1, guest_2, and guest_3 with each function call.
