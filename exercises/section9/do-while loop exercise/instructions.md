## Do-while loop exercise
Exercise: Find the First Vowel in a Vector

Specification: Write a C++ program that uses a do-while loop to find the first English vowel in a hard-coded std::vector of characters. The vector should contain a mixture of vowels and consonants (for example: {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}). The program should print the first vowel found in the vector. If no vowel is found, it should print a message indicating that no vowel was found.

Instructions

You will be writing your code within the provided function find_first_vowel(const std::vector<char>&  vec). Do not change the function name or its parameter.

Do-While Loop: Utilize a do-while loop to iterate through the characters in the provided std::vector<char> named vec.

Vowel Identification: In each iteration, check if the current character is a lowercase English vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Output:

If a vowel is found, use cout to display: "Vowel found: " followed by the vowel.

If no vowel is found in the entire vector, display: "No vowel was found".

Examples: Here are some sample vectors and the expected output:

For vector {'f','r','a','n','k'}, your function should output: Vowel found: a.

For vector {'F','R','A','N','K'}, your function should output: No vowel was found.

For vector {'h','e','l','l','o'}, your function should output: Vowel found: e.

For an empty vector {}, your function should output: No vowel was found.

For vector {'x','y','z','o'}, your function should output: Vowel found: o.

Do Not Add Line Breaks: Please ensure that you do not add std::endl or '\n' to your output.

Code Placement: Write your code between the comments
//---- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE---- and //---- WRITE YOUR CODE ABOVE THIS LINE----.

Notes

Ensure your solution works correctly for all the provided examples and considers the case of an empty vector.

Focus on correctly implementing the do-while loop and the logic for checking each character.

Your solution should be efficient and neatly formatted to maintain readability.
