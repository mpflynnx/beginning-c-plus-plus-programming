## Solution

```c
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
 
int calculate_pairs(vector<int> vec) {
    //----WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE----
    int result{};
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i)
       for (size_t j = i + 1; j < vec.size(); ++j) 
            result = result + vec.at(i) * vec.at(j);
    
    //----WRITE YOUR CODE ABOVE THIS LINE----
    //----DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE BELOW THIS LINE----
    return result;
}
```

An integer variable named result is declared and initialized to 0. This variable will store the cumulative sum of products.

The code then uses nested for loops to iterate over all possible pairs of integers in the vector. The outer loop uses the index variable i to iterate from 0 to vec.size() - 1, and the inner loop uses the index variable j to iterate from i + 1 to vec.size() - 1.

For each pair of indices (i, j) where i is less than j, the code multiplies the values at those indices (vec.at(i) and vec.at(j)) and adds the result to the result variable.

After all pairs have been processed, the final value of result represents the sum of products of all possible pairs of integers in the vector.



Overall, this code calculates the sum of products of all possible pairs of integers in the given vector.
